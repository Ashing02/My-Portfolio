#My Software Engineering Portfolio 
My Programming Portfolio
Hi there! Welcome to my portfolio, where I showcase my projects, skills, and passion for creating innovative solutions.

About Me
Hi there! I'm a surviving computer science student navigating the world of algorithms and debugging one day at a time. While my coding journey is a work in progress (let’s just say I have my “HAHAHA” moments), I enjoy the creative process and the satisfaction of getting things to work.

Outside of the digital realm, I'm a dancer at heart, letting loose and expressing myself through movement in my leisure time. Music is my constant companion—whether I’m coding, chilling, or dancing, there’s always a playlist that matches my vibe.

Interests
Enjoy creating innovative solutions and user-friendly applications.
Constantly curious and eager to learn and innovate.
Creative thinker with a passion for exploring new ideas.
Tech enthusiast who loves discovering the latest trends in technology.
Adaptable learner, ready to take on challenges in and out of code.

Skills
Programming: Turning ideas into functional code.
UI/UX Design: Designing user-friendly interfaces for better user experiences.
Cramming: Expert in last-minute productivity under pressure!
Procrastinating: Still making it work despite the delay.
Dancing: Expressing creativity through movement.
Projects
1. Simple Calculator
A straightforward program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). This project demonstrates user-friendly input handling and essential mathematical logic.

2. Regular Grammar String Generator
A tool designed to generate strings from a formal language using regular grammar rules. Users can define production rules, specify output length, and explore language generation concepts interactively.

3. Smart Home Automated System
An innovative system for managing and automating home devices, complete with features like energy monitoring, device scheduling, and remote control. This project integrates advanced functionality to simplify daily life.

4. Snake Game
A classic arcade game where the player navigates a growing snake to collect points while avoiding collisions. This project showcases my knowledge of game loops, user input handling, and basic game mechanics.

5. Tic-Tac-Toe
A timeless two-player strategy game implemented with a clean and responsive design. This project highlights logical algorithms and user interaction in a competitive gaming environment.

6. To-Do List
A simple yet effective task management application that allows users to add, update, and delete tasks. This project demonstrates my skills in building organized, goal-oriented applications for productivity.
