## 👩‍💻 About Me  

Hi there! I'm a surviving computer science student navigating the world of algorithms and debugging one day at a time. While my coding journey is a work in progress (let’s just say I have my "HAHAHA" moments), I enjoy the creative process and the satisfaction of getting things to work.  

Outside of the digital realm, I'm a dancer at heart, expressing myself through movement during my leisure time. 🎶 Music is my constant companion—whether I’m coding, chilling, or dancing, there’s always a playlist that matches my vibe.
